A singly linked list is a data structure used to store a collection of elements. It consists of nodes, where each node contains two main components:

Data: The value or information stored in the node.
Next Pointer: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
Key Features:
Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, singly linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically.
Sequential Access: Elements can be accessed sequentially, starting from the head (the first node).
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting nodes can be done efficiently without needing to shift elements, as is necessary with arrays.
Basic Operations:
Insertion: Adding a new node at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
Deletion: Removing a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Traversal: Accessing each node in the list, typically starting from the head and following the next pointers until reaching the end (where the next pointer is null).
